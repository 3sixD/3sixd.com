<blockquote>“Having been an IT consultant for over twenty years, I have witnessed the old-school ‘brick and mortar’ model of contract agencies, with large overhead requiring large margins and hard sell tactics. 3sixD keeps a small, agile workforce that <span class="highlight">focuses on the contractor</span>, built to attract the most talented employees at the best margins in the business. We focus on the contractor, knowing that if we provide the best, we'll get the best, and that will attract the clients.”
